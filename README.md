## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to develop more functions of JavaScript to generate the password, had to go deeper into learning more concepts to be able to complete this challenge.

Used Sass and tried to use it's concepts to help me achieve better stylesheets code.

Made a validation for a case when the user puts a length smaller than the number of checkboxes marked.
